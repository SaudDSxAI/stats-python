# Python Statistics & Data Visualization Practice

## Overview
This project is a collection of Python scripts demonstrating fundamental concepts in statistics and data visualization. It covers descriptive statistics, random number generation, covariance, plotting with matplotlib, and histogram creation. The project reflects my journey in learning statistics, Python programming, and data analysis through hands-on practice.

## Features
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate mean, median, mode, average, variance, standard deviation, and range using numpy and scipy.
- **Random Number Generation:** Generate random floats, integers, and select random elements from a list.
- **Covariance Calculation:** Compute covariance between columns of pandas DataFrames.
- **Line Plotting:** Visualize data trends with matplotlib line plots.
- **Histogram Plotting:** Display data distributions using histograms.

## How It Works
- Each script demonstrates a specific statistical or visualization concept:
  - `practice1.py`: Descriptive statistics functions and usage.
  - `practice2.py`: Random number generation and selection.
  - `practice3.py`: Covariance calculation with pandas DataFrames.
  - `practice4.py`: Line plot with custom labels and legends.
  - `practice5.py`: Histogram plotting for data distribution.

## My Learning Journey
Through this project, I learned:
- The basics of descriptive statistics and their implementation in Python.
- How to use numpy, scipy, pandas, and matplotlib for data analysis.
- The importance of visualizing data to understand trends and distributions.
- Writing modular, reusable code for statistical analysis.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Required: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.
   - Install with: `pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib`
2. **Run Scripts:**
   - Execute any script (e.g., `python practice1.py`) to see the concept in action.
   - Modify scripts or input data to experiment and deepen your understanding.

## File Structure
- `practice1.py`: Descriptive statistics
- `practice2.py`: Random number generation
- `practice3.py`: Covariance calculation
- `practice4.py`: Line plot example
- `practice5.py`: Histogram example
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions
